## Usage

[Click here to check it out!](https://cosuggestionbox.com/)

Simply choose a command from the selection box and type your message. Your suggestion will be forwarded to the registered address for that command and handled accordingly. All submissions are anonymous, however, should avoid the use of identifying details or inappropriate language.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Roadmap

I'm interested in completing the login and registration forms to allow commands to sign up and register their email address for suggestion purposes. This will require additional functionality to determine which command has been selected and their recipient address.
